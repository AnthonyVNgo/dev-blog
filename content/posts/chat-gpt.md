As a junior that's just broken into the industry, I'm spending most of my time learning new tools and technologies. As such, I'm spending most of my days Googling and researching to get things going and have found ChatGPT really useful with pair-programming and rubber duck debugging (not sure if I'm using those terms correctly, but oh well).

Not sure what ChatGPT is? This [link](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=what+is+chatgpt) should help.

Here's how I've been using ChatGPT to get caught up on new concepts and learn abstract ideas.

1. **Get a broad high level overview** 
<br>
In the context of learning new tools and tech, I usually find myself running into foreign concepts. Because of that, my favorite prompt is a variation of: 
<br>
ELI5 what [subject] is in 3-5 sentences
<br><br>
Here's an example:
<br> 
ELI5 what CSF3 is in the context of Storybook UI in 3 sentences
<br><br>
I use ELI5, which stands for explain like I'm five, to hopefully get an output that is easy to interpret. I add the "in 3 sentences" part because ChatGPT tends to give bloated responses. Including this limitation usually forces ChatGPT to output the core concepts.

2. **Zoom in and clarify**
<br>
After getting the high level concepts, I usually ask for clarification on bits of the output that I don't understand. I like to follow up with:
<br>
Expand on [subject], rephrase the output, etc 
<br><br>
I rinse and repeat until I have a clearer picture of the subject
<br> 

3. **Validate and Confirm**
<br>
After a couple rounds of clarification, I would confirm if I have a grasp of the concept by using the following prompt: 
<br>
Is it correct to say that... something something about subject
<br><br>
At this point, ChatGPT will either say something like, "Yes! That is correct..." or "No ..."
<br>
If ChatGPT says no, then we circle back to steps two and three. If ChatGPT says yes, then we're done and move forward. 

And that's all there is to how I use ChatGPT to learn new concepts. 

On top of ChatGPT's outputs, I found that just the practice of formulating a well thought question / prompt assists in seeing things in a different perspective which helps tie things together. 

Of course it's always a good idea to fact check via docs and other sources as well. ChatGPT isn't perfect and I've run into many blatant errors, but referencing other sources and going through this workflow has usually led me in the right direction.
